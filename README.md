Currently supports:
- Regression and binary classification problems
- Xgboost, lightgbm and all sklearn models
- Input data in forms of pd.DataFrame or np.array or scipy.csr_matrix
- Fold splitting can be done on unique values of given column
- Custom metrics

To be added:
- Target feature encoding
- Support of fastfm and Keras NNets
- Support of milticlass classification problems
